# Traffic Sign Classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras and TensorFlow to classify traffic signs. The model is trained on a dataset sourced from Kaggle, containing various traffic signs commonly found in Germany. The primary objective is to develop a robust classification model capable of accurately identifying different traffic signs, with potential applications in autonomous vehicles and road safety systems.

### Key Features:
1. CNN Architecture: Utilizes a custom-designed CNN architecture optimized for traffic sign classification tasks.
2. Data Preprocessing: Implements data preprocessing techniques including resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance model performance.
3. Model Training: Trains the CNN model on the preprocessed dataset using Keras with TensorFlow backend.
4. Evaluation and Validation: Evaluates the model's performance.
5. Testing and Deployment: Tests the trained model using a separate test dataset and explores deployment options for real-world applications.
